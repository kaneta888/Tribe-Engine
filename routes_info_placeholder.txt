# Define Blueprint directly here for simplicity in single-file-like structure, 
# but best practice is to move to a routes folder. 
# For this step, I'll modify app.py to include these or create a routes/auth.py.
# I will create 'routes/auth.py' and import it in app.py.

# This file content is intended for routes/auth.py
